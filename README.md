The colored numbers are the group a cell is in. To start every cell has a unique group, but you will need to edit that so that each group has the same id.
The borders of each cell will also dynamically change so that the division between groups has a thicker border.
To easily select a group, simply click and drag from a starting cell and select each cell of the group. This will automatically set the group of each cell to the group of the cell when you first pressed down.
When you finished editing the groups, it might look something like this:
